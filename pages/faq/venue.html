        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h4 id="1-which-nights-of-accommodation-are-included-in-the-summit-ticket--accommodation---5-days-code-i-wanted-to-know-if-sunday-night-is-included-so-that-i-can-arrive-on-sunday">1. Which nights of accommodation are included in the summit ticket + accommodation - 5 days code? I wanted to know if Sunday night is included so that I can arrive on Sunday.</h4>

<p>The 24h-5day tickets cover catering/lodging from Monday morning until Friday evening (exact hours to be verified).
This does not include Sunday night.</p>

<h4 id="2--i-have-a-non-uk-vat-number-can-you-apply-the-reverse-charge-vat-mechanism">2.  I have a non-UK VAT number, can you apply the reverse charge VAT mechanism?</h4>

<p>OWASP charges UK VAT (value added tax) of 19% on all tickets, which can be claimed back from your national tax authorities.
Where a General Rule service is supplied from a supplier in one Member State to a customer in another Member State, the invoice
from the supplier is free of VAT and the customer accounts for the VAT due in their Member State by applying the reverse charge.
However, the service that OWASP will provide you – admission to an event in UK – does not fall within the General Rule; different rules apply there. This is detailed in Article 53 of the VAT Directive (2006/112/EC), which states: “Article 53. The place of
supply of services in respect of admission to cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment or similar events,
such as fairs and exhibitions, and of ancillary services related to the admission, supplied to a taxable person, shall be the place where
those events actually take place.”</p>

<p>The UK VAT that you incur may be recoverable by making a claim under the Refund Directive 2008/9/EC. This involves making a claim directly
to your national tax authorities via their electronic portal.</p>

<h4 id="3-how-do-i-get-to-the-summit">3. How do I get to the summit?</h4>

<p>RAIL</p>

<p>Thameslink offers a service from London St Pancras International to Flitwick Train Station, which takes approximately 50 minutes. Flitwick station is approximately 3 miles, or a 10-minute transfer away; taxis are available at the station.</p>

<p>ROAD</p>

<p>From the South using the M1</p>

<p>Leave at junction 13, NOT at junction 12 as suggested by some ‘Sat Navs’.

Continue on the A507 for 4 miles to Millbrook roundabout. Take the third exit into Fordfield Road. The entrance to Center Parcs, Woburn Forest is 500 yards on the right.</p>

<p>From the East and West using the M1</p>
